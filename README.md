The five directories in this folder are a mini-course meant to
bridge the gap between an introductory CS class (i.e., CS32 or
CS50) and a systems programming class (i.e., CS61). In other
words, this self-paced mini-course takes you from knowing
how to program in C or Python and introduces you to the basics
of programming in C++.

**To get started:**

1.  Open the `1SyntaxDiffs` folder in your IDE's file browser.
2.  In your IDE's shell window, type `cd 1SyntaxDiffs` and hit
    return.
3.  Open `lesson/instructions.md` in your IDE's editor and work
    through what you find there

After you complete this first lesson, you'll find the next
one in `2Types`. Repeat the "get started" directions with 
this directory name. Continue through the directories in
order of their initial number.

The instructions assume you're doing your work in the Replit
IDE, but any IDE will work.
