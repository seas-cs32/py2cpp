The five directories in this folder are a mini-course meant to
bridge the gap between an introductory CS class (i.e., CS32 or
CS50) and a systems programming class (i.e., CS61). In other
words, this self-paced mini-course takes you from knowing
how to program in C or Python and introduces you to the basics
of programming in C++.

**To get started**, read the `instructions.md` file in the
directory `1SyntaxDiffs/lesson`.

After you complete this initial lesson, you'll find the next
one in `2Types/lesson/instructions.md`. Continue through the
directories in order of their first number.

The instructions assume you're doing your work in the Replit
IDE, but any IDE will work.
