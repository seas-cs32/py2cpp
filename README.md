The five directories in this folder are a mini-course meant to
bridge the gap between an introductory CS class (i.e., CS32 or
CS50) and a systems programming class (i.e., CS61). In other
words, this self-paced mini-course takes you from knowing
how to program in C or Python and introduces you to the basics
of programming in C++.

**To clone this project in Replit**

The instructions in this mini-course assume you're doing your
work in the Replit IDE, but any IDE will work. To use
[Replit](https://www.replit.com), login and:

1.  Click the "Import from GitHub" button. 
2.  Click the "From URL" tab in the dialog box.
3.  In the "GitHub Repository URL box, type `https://github.com/seas-cs32/py2cpp.git`
4.  Click the "Import from GitHub" button.
5.  As the project starts up, you'll see a window called "Configure Repl" in which you can scroll to the bottom and click the "Confirm and close" button (i.e., I've preconfigured things).

**To get started with the first lesson**

1.  Open the `1SyntaxDiffs` folder in your IDE's file browser.
2.  In your IDE's shell window, type `cd 1SyntaxDiffs` and hit
    return.
3.  Open `1SyntaxDiffs/lesson/instructions.md` in your IDE's
    editor and work through what you find there.

After you complete this first lesson, you'll find the next
one in `2Types`. Repeat the "get started" directions with 
this directory name. Continue through the directories in
order of their initial number.

Happy learning!
